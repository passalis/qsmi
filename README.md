# Quadratic Spherical Mutual Information for Deep Supervised Image Hashing

Quadratic Spherical Mutual Information for Deep Supervised Image Hashing


In this repository we provide an implementation of the Quadratic Spherical Mutual Information for Deep Supervised Image Hashing approach (currently under review). Please check the demo.py to find out how you can easily use the proposed method. The following results should be obtained if you run the demo.py:



| bits    | mAP     | precision < 2bits  |
| --------|:-------:| :-----------------:|
| 12      | 0.842   | 0.865              |
| 24      | 0.873   | 0.891              |
| 36      | 0.863   | 0.880              |
| 48      | 0.860   | 0.875              |
